// FFT-BASED MDS MULTIPLICATION HELPER FUNCTIONS
// ================================================================================================

//! This module contains helper functions as well as constants used to perform the vector-matrix
//! multiplication step of the Rescue prime permutation. The special form of our MDS matrix
//! i.e. being circular, allows us to reduce the vector-matrix multiplication to a Hadamard product
//! of two vectors in "frequency domain". This follows from the simple fact that every circulant
//! matrix has the columns of the discrete Fourier transform matrix as orthogonal eigenvectors.
//! The implementation also avoids the use of 3-point FFTs, and 3-point iFFTs, and substitutes that
//! with explicit expressions. It also avoids, due to the form of our matrix in the frequency
//! domain, divisions by 2 and repeated modular reductions. This is because of our explicit choice
//! of an MDS matrix that has small powers of 2 entries in frequency domain.
//! The following implementation has benefited greatly from the discussions and insights of
//! Hamish Ivey-Law and Jacqueline Nabaglo of Polygon Zero and is base on Nabaglo's Plonky2
//! implementation.

// Rescue MDS matrix in frequency domain.
//
// More precisely, this is the output of the three 4-point (real) FFTs of the first column of
// the MDS matrix i.e. just before the multiplication with the appropriate twiddle factors
// and application of the final four 3-point FFT in order to get the full 12-point FFT.
// The entries have been scaled appropriately in order to avoid divisions by 2 in iFFT2 and iFFT4.
// The code to generate the matrix in frequency domain is based on an adaptation of a code, to
// generate MDS matrices efficiently in original domain, that was developed by the Polygon Zero
// team.
