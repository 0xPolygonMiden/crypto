//! A fully materialized Merkle mountain range (MMR).
//!
//! A MMR is a forest structure, i.e. it is an ordered set of disjoint rooted trees. The trees are
//! ordered by size, from the most to least number of leaves. Every tree is a perfect binary tree,
//! meaning a tree has all its leaves at the same depth, and every inner node has a branch-factor
//! of 2 with both children set.
//!
//! Additionally the structure only supports adding leaves to the right-most tree, the one with the
//! least number of leaves. The structure preserves the invariant that each tree has different
//! depths, i.e. as part of adding adding a new element to the forest the trees with same depth are
//! merged, creating a new tree with depth d+1, this process is continued until the property is
//! reestablished.
